# üéµ Spotify Playlist Sorter

A Node.js web application that sorts your Spotify playlists by release date using the Spotify Web API. Organize your music chronologically with just a few clicks!

## ‚ú® Features

- **OAuth Authentication**: Secure login with your Spotify account
- **Playlist Selection**: Choose from all your playlists (both public and private)
- **Release Date Sorting**: Automatically sort tracks from oldest to newest release date
- **Smart Date Handling**: Handles different date precisions (year, month, day)
- **Beautiful Web Interface**: Clean, responsive design with Spotify-inspired styling
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles playlists of any size
- **Real-time Feedback**: See sorting progress and results immediately

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- A Spotify account
- Spotify Developer App credentials

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd spotify-playlist-sorter
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Spotify API Credentials

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
2. Create a new app or use an existing one
3. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Add `http://localhost:3000/callback` to your app's Redirect URIs

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your Spotify credentials:
   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
   PORT=3000
   ```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
# Development mode (with auto-restart)
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

### 6. Use the Application

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Connect to Spotify" to authenticate
3. Select a playlist from your library
4. Click "Sort by Release Date" and watch the magic happen!

## üìñ How It Works

### Sorting Algorithm

The application sorts tracks by their album release dates using the following logic:

1. **Date Parsing**: Handles different precision levels from Spotify:
   - `day`: Full date (e.g., "2023-03-15")
   - `month`: Year and month (e.g., "2023-03")
   - `year`: Year only (e.g., "2023")

2. **Sorting Order**: Tracks are sorted from oldest to newest release date

3. **Missing Dates**: Tracks without release dates are placed at the end

4. **Playlist Update**: The original playlist is updated with the new track order

### API Integration

- Uses the `spotify-web-api-node` library for clean API interactions
- Implements OAuth 2.0 flow for secure authentication
- Handles token refresh automatically
- Respects Spotify API rate limits with proper error handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Project Structure

```
spotify-playlist-sorter/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js                 # Main application server
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spotifyService.js    # Spotify API integration
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playlistSorter.js    # Sorting logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Run the application in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Run with nodemon for development
- `npm test` - Run tests (placeholder)

### Adding New Features

The application is designed to be easily extensible:

1. **New Sorting Methods**: Add methods to `PlaylistSorter` class
2. **Additional API Endpoints**: Extend routes in `index.js`
3. **Enhanced UI**: Modify the HTML templates or add static files
4. **Database Integration**: Add persistence for user preferences

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Your Spotify app's Client ID | Required |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your Spotify app's Client Secret | Required |
| `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` | OAuth redirect URI | `http://localhost:3000/callback` |
| `PORT` | Server port | `3000` |

### Spotify API Scopes

The application requests the following permissions:
- `user-read-private` - Access user profile
- `user-read-email` - Access user email
- `playlist-read-private` - Read private playlists
- `playlist-read-collaborative` - Read collaborative playlists
- `playlist-modify-private` - Modify private playlists
- `playlist-modify-public` - Modify public playlists

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Check your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Ensure the redirect URI matches exactly
   - Verify your Spotify app settings

2. **"Failed to get playlists"**
   - Make sure you've granted the necessary permissions
   - Try re-authenticating with Spotify

3. **"Error sorting playlist"**
   - Ensure the playlist isn't empty
   - Check that you have edit permissions for the playlist
   - Some playlists may contain tracks that are no longer available

### Debug Mode

Add this to your `.env` file for more detailed logging:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
```
